    <string name="data">hello Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem hello Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a hello galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It hello has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, hello remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of hello Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop hello publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of hello Lorem Ipsum. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical hello literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The hello Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, hello very popular during the Renaissance. The first line ofhello Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the hello1500s is reproduced below for those interested. hello Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also helloreproduced in their exact hello original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation hello by H. Rackham.</string>
